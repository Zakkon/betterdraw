SYNCING
--------
Lazy Way, relying on scene flags (deprecated):
>When layer is created, we put all the layer info (including texture buffer) in the scene flags
>When clients join, they will already know the scene flags, and be able to reproduce the texture
>GM will need to update the buffer at the end of every stroke, to keep the texture updated
>clients will have their updateScene hook called, and use that fresh buffer to rebuild the texture
Problems:
setting scene flags is quite slow, and *will* cause framedrops when applying the buffer
------------------------
Intermediate Way, using scene flags & socket messages (deprecated):
>Works the same way as Lazy Way, but we send StrokeParts during the stroke through the socket
>clients recieving the StrokeParts can replicate the drawing in realtime on their texture
>the StrokeParts needs a timestamp, which is compared to the timestamp of the most recent scene flags update, stored in the scene flags itself
>if the scene flags update is more recent then the StrokePart, that means the StrokePart is outdated and we can simply use the buffer within the scene flags instead
-----------------------
NEW DEVELOPMENT, SCENE FLAGS CANNOT BE USED
Storing the texture buffer in sceneFlags causes tremendous lag when moving characters around on the map
-----------------------
Using an image file instead of scene flags (in development)
>Non-GM client can load a texture straight from the server and render that onto the layer object
>GM handles saving/updating that image file when it deems nessesary
>GM will cache StrokeParts in the scene flags
>When the GM finally updates the image file, all StrokeParts are also deleted, since they are out of date. Clients then load from the image file
-----------------------
SCENE STARTUP BUGS:
-----------------
FROM NOSCENE +F5 TO NEW SCENE:
>Detects pixelmap texture is gone, thats ok.
>Reaches config screen, all good so far
>Save config screen changes, scene.update is called, then CanvasInit_on. Lag starts here due to LayerSettings.Save
>In CanvasInit_on, we detect that the pixelmap is once again gone, and the drawlayer.layer aswell. so we recreate those
>After create new drawlayer screen, loadaction is called which rescales the scene, calling scene.update
>Loadaction then calls .init on drawlayer, which sees that the pixelmap texture and drawlayer.layer are once again destroyed, so we recreate those
>Foundry then draws the scene, CanvasInit_on is called
>In CanvasInit_on, we see that the pixelmap texture is ONCE AGAIN destroyed, so we rebuild it. drawlayer.layer seems to have survived
>rendertexture seems completely blank
---------------
we need to figure out what to do in all of the hooks
CANVASINIT_ON:
>Pixelmap.texture (a rendertexture) is almost certainly destroyed and needs repairing + buffer added
