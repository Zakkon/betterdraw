VERSION ONE: Lazy Mode (functioning)
>Texture is stored in scene flags upon the GM completing the "create new layer" dialog
>Sceneflags keeps getting updated with the fresh texture each time the GM finishes drawing a stroke
>Clients joining the session have immediate access to the sceneflags, and thus the texture
>Clients detect changes to the scene flags with the updateScene hook, and can then refresh their displayed texture with the fresh texture data
