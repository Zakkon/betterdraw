SYNCING
--------
Module keeps a hard copy of the layer image as an image file that lives in the module data folder on the server
>Non-GM clients can read that file and render it on the layer canvas
>Ontop of that, any changes made since the last save (of the image file) is stored in the scene flags, as StrokeParts
>When a GM uses a brush, StrokeParts are saved in the scene flags, aswell as sent directly through sockets to the clients
>Non-GM clients recieve these StrokeParts and render them on the layer canvas
>Non-GM that are hotjoining can recreate the current texture by readin the image file, and then applying all StokeParts cached in the scene flags
>When the GM finally updates the image file, all StrokeParts are also deleted, since they are out of date. Clients then load from the image file and render that on their layer canvas

SCENE STARTUP BUGS:
-----------------
FROM NOSCENE +F5 TO NEW SCENE:
>Detects pixelmap texture is gone, thats ok.
>Reaches config screen, all good so far
>Save config screen changes, scene.update is called, then CanvasInit_on. Lag starts here due to LayerSettings.Save
>In CanvasInit_on, we detect that the pixelmap is once again gone, and the drawlayer.layer aswell. so we recreate those
>After create new drawlayer screen, loadaction is called which rescales the scene, calling scene.update
>Loadaction then calls .init on drawlayer, which sees that the pixelmap texture and drawlayer.layer are once again destroyed, so we recreate those
>Foundry then draws the scene, CanvasInit_on is called
>In CanvasInit_on, we see that the pixelmap texture is ONCE AGAIN destroyed, so we rebuild it. drawlayer.layer seems to have survived
>rendertexture seems completely blank
---------------
we need to figure out what to do in all of the hooks
CANVASINIT_ON:
>Pixelmap.texture (a rendertexture) is almost certainly destroyed and needs repairing + buffer added
