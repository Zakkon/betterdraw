CORRUPTION TESTING
-------------------------------
Delete image file: print error, parse surviving layersettings, end result is a flat image with the correct dimensions painted in background color + strokes
Delete layer settings: new default layer settings are created
Delete strokes: everything functions, strokes are simply not drawn
Resize scene using scene config menu: everything survives, but layer image is obviously no longer scaled to proportionaly match desired grid size
